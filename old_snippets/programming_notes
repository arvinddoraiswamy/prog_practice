Hints:
* READ the problem carefully. If something does not make sense **after** you've solved it, read again.
* Get ONE solution right first. It's OK if its brute-force. Don't fine tune too fast -> Recipe for disaster
* Build your test input up. Start really simple.
* Lesser variables will make your program faster but figure this out *after* you have a working program
* Debug your program from where the input comes IN. Not from where you see the error.
* Blank values, new lines, data types are major enemies. Print type(var) out from time to time.
* Remember to reset your variables :) :)
  2 values which you want to skip
* Make sure you don't have any print statements :)
* Figure out how to generate general formulas
* Try to avoid list copying

Python:

* break only breaks out of your innermost loop. "continue" is when you want to do something with all values except 1 or
* If you want to swap, use lists. Do NOT use strings or tuples - they're immutable
* lexicographic sorting is best done on strings
* list1 = list2 is a reference. Use list1 = list2[:]
* Use classes for linked lists. No random access possible

Terminology:

* Meta string - strings that can be made equal by 1 swap in either string
* Jumping number - Numbers where every adjacent digit differs by exactly 1

Not solved:
* Flood fill (Got the recursion bit, but logic is flawed)
* Knapsack (need to try again, now that I understand recursion)
* Alternate OR/XOR: Too slow. Suspect list copying
